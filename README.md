Today, I learned tuples in python. 

Tuples are ordered, unchangeable arrays in python. Tuples allow duplication of values. The values are inserted inside round brackets (parenthesis). length of the tuple can be accessed using len() method. Tuples are indexed so the values or items in tuples can be accessed using the index value starting from 0: sampletuple[index]. Tuples can have one value. It is defined simmilar to multi value tuples but comma is needed at the end of the value. The type of the tuple can be displayed using type() method.
