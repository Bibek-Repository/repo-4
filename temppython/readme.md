Python Interpreter

A python interpreter is the software that runs the python code.
When there are multiple versions of Python installed, or there is a virtual environment(like venv, virtualenv or conda), we need to select the right interpreter for the project in VS code.
Each environment can have its own set of installed packages, including TensorFlow.

Why Select the Interpreter?
When installing Tensorflow using pip install tensorflow, it is installed in a specific environment.
If there are multiple Python environments, TensorFlow might only be installed in one of them.
To ensure that VS Code uses the environment where Tensorflow is installed, the selection of the appropriate Python interpreter is important.

How to Select the Python INterpreter in VS Code:
Open the Command Palette:
This opens a tex input box at the top of the VS Code window where you can type commands.

Type "Python: Select Interpreter":
Choose Python: Select Interpreter. 

Choose the Right Interpreter:

We will see a list of available Python interpreters. These might include system-wide installations, virtual environments, and conda environments.
Look for the one where TensorFlow is installed. It might have a path like path/to/venv/bin/python(for virtual environments) or path/to/conda/env/python.
Select the interpreter, and VS code will use this environment for running Pythonn scripts.

Result
After selecting the correct interpreter:
VS Code will recognize all the packages installed in that environment.
Errors like Import "tensorflow.keras.layers" will be fixed.
The Python scripts will run using the selected interpreter, which should have TensorFlow and any other necessary libraries.
