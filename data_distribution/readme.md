Random Data Distribution
Data Distribution is a list of all possible values, and how often each value occurs. Such lists are important when working with statistics and data science. The random module offer methods that returns randomly generated data distributions. A random distribution is a set of random numbers that follow a certain probability density function.
Probability Density Function is a function that describes a continuous probability. i.e. probability of all values in an array. We can generate random numbers based on defined probabilites using the choice() method of the random module. The choice() method allows us to specify the probability for each value. The probability is set by a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the value will never occur and 1 means that the value will always occur. The sum of all probability numbers should be 1.

Random Permutations
A permutation refers to an arrangement of elements. The NumPy Random module provides two methods for this: shuffle() and permutation(). The shuffle() method makes changes to the orignal array. The permutation() method returns a array which is changed.
